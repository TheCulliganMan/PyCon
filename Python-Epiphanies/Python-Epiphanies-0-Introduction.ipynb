    "> If in your use of Python you sometimes feel like an outsider, like you're missing the inside jokes, like you have most of the puzzle pieces but they don't quite fit together yet, or like there are parts of Python you just don't get, this may be a good tutorial for you.\n",

    "- Math: a value that varies, algebra\n",
    "- Most programming languages, books, courses, and culture:\n",
    "  - Compiler reserves memory and issues type-specific instructions\n",
    "  - Assignment changes the value in memory\n",
    "  - Aliases are rare except as function arguments passed by reference\n",
    "- Python:\n",
    "  - Shares math definition with programming languages\n",
    "  - Unlike traditional programming language definition\n",
    "  - To avoid the baggage, say \"names\" and \"objects\"\n",

    "#### About this Tutorial\n",
    "- Review objects and how they're created\n",
    "- How names actually work - how to think about them and how to talk about them\n",
    "- Cover all the places in Python that bind names, with some detours\n",
    "- Lots of examples, don't expect to catch all of them\n",
    "- Uses introspection, not always in recommended ways\n",
    "- Probably won't complete last 2 sections\n",
    "- Please interrupt with questions, but I may postpone some answers"
