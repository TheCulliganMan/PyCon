# PyCon

Notes and notebooks from pycon.

## Down the Rabbit Hole

### Reproducible data flows in Python

This will be extremely useful for all our work.


## Epiphanies

### Python's Quirks

Not that useful, but kind of interestings

## Network Analysis 101

### NetworkX + NXVis

Extremely useful. With many practical examples.  I think we need a graph database.  Bonus notebook three 
could be a lifesaver in Alex's project.

* NOTEBOOK 5!!!! BONUS NOTEBOOK 3 *

### Using Pandas For Better (Or Worse) 

You already know all of this.  If you don't somebody else in the group does.  Probably not worth your time.
